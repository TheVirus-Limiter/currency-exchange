# Currency Comparison and Conversion Web App

## Overview

This is a currency comparison and conversion web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to:
- Compare an amount in a given currency against several common currencies.
- Convert amounts between various currencies, including a custom selection.
- View country details based on the currency (including country name, population, and GDP).
- Receive AI-generated trading advice for currency conversions.

The application uses real-time exchange rate data from the [Fixer.io API](https://fixer.io/) and country data from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/). Additionally, it integrates AI-powered trading advice via [Hugging Face API](https://huggingface.co/), specifically the [Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct Model](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct).

6. AI-powered trading advice is displayed suggesting whether to buy, sell, or hold the USD/CAD pair.

## API Keys
